- Made `v7` the default branch

### v7.2.0
- Switched from Kurigram to [pyrofork](https://github.com/Mayuri-Chan/pyrofork/) due to connection issues (I hate framework hopping)

### v7.1.3a
- Cleans the download dir on startup (especially helps when the bot is running with a volume attached)
- Fixed issues with the lockfile that prevented the bot from starting

### v7.1.0a
- Stop using `return await` in async functions
- Apply my very own code style on top of black
  - manually done yet
  - inspired by my heavily modified ESLint Stylistic config (https://github.com/EDM115/website/blob/master/eslint.config.js)

- Migrate from `pyrogram` to `pyroblack`

### v7.0.3a
- :warning: **Security fix** : The bot is no longer vulnerable to user attacks, see [GHSA-34cg-7f8c-fm5h / CVE-2024-53992](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/security/advisories/GHSA-34cg-7f8c-fm5h) for more info
  - Uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell()` instead of the hackish way that was present before
  - Uses `shlex` to sanitize user input for shell commands (file paths and archive passwords)

- Bumped aiohttp

### v7.0.1a
- Strings processing is entirely redone
  - ALL strings are in JSON files, which will help with future translation
  - Only English supported for now
  - Deleted unused strings, moved plain text to the JSON, fixed grammar mistakes
  - Split buttons and messages processing

- More commands that were restricted to the Bot Owner can now be run outside of DM, ex in the logs group (if they're not anonymous)
- `7zip` is now installed from the `edge` repository to fix an issue with volumes creation
- During the split of a file, it is now moved to a temp location to avoid filename clash
- Users can finally cancel a task (see [#28](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/issues/28)), however it doesn't work perfectly for split archives download for example
- The canceled task list is cleared at each restart and every 5 min

- Fixed TAR archives being broken (basically a `.tar.gz` would only upload the `.tar` inside)
- Archives are no longer renamed to "archive_from_ID.ext"

- Added `/dbexport`, `/commands`, `/admincmd`
- Added `exec()` and `eval()`, but not usable now

### v4.0.7
